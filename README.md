kaggle-Titanic challenge

## Procedure
1. Data preprocessing
2. Build your machine learning models
3. Assess your models' performances
4. Adjust the parameters and try again
5. Submit your results

### First submission
Prepared 3 models(logistic, svm and mlp), and a voting classifier, but mlp is better currently.

Only use the mlp model(current best) for submission, which has 77.5% accuracy, ranked 5407 in the public leaderboard.

#### How to run
1. You will need to install numpy, sklearn, pandas, etc. (anaconda is recommended)
2. Run Titanic_v1.py: $python3 Titanic_v1.py
3. See the generated file result_v1.csv file
